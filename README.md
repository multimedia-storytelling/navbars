# navbars
Demo of Bootstrap 4 navbars

Color each navbar item by creating a new class for that color, e.g., nav-item-gray. Be sure to remove the padding top and bottom on the navbar itself. Otherwise, the class color will not cover the entire navbar item.

nav-item height must be set...using 40px in the example. This gets rid of space top/bottom around the arrow.

Known bug in Firefox and Chrome (at extra large width): thin line appears between nav-items
